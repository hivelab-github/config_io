# lidar_parameters_config
First entered the gate of github, I hope I will be better in the future.
## What it does
When writing a program, you often encounter a variety of parameters. If the parameters are written directly in the program, the program needs to be recompiled each time it is modified. When the number is increasing, the modification becomes difficult. Therefore, it is an excellent way to define a configuration file outside the program,and the contents of the configuration file are read while the program is running. In this way, each modification only needs to change the content of the configuration file, and the program itself does not modify it.
Config_io provides configuration parameters, and the main program reads the parameter file by calling the Config_io built-in function. The parameter file is placed in the Config folder and is the relevant data of the lidar. By specifying the parameters of the lidar and inputing the parameters that need to be searched, the corresponding parameter values can be obtained.
## How does it workï¼ŸYou should really read itï¼Œit's important! 
Usage:
      #include "config_io.h" 
      using hivelab_config_io::Config; 
//Read the Config_ini fileï¼š 
      Config::SetConfigPath("mypath/config.ini"); 
      //Or : Config::UseDefaultPath("config.ini"); 
//Read the parameters you needï¼š 
      float var=Config::Get("FieldName","VarName"); 
## Additional information
A small test program was placed under the test folder to  read some of the data, and the error was specifically shown.The results of testing in kdevelop are as follows.
Resultï¼š
Config Read INFO: Read 6 config fields.
Config Read INFO: Read 34 config contents.
